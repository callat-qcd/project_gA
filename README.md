# project g<sub>A</sub>

This project is for the analysis code and data files for our calculation of g<sub>A</sub> with MDWF on HISQ, and contains the following:
* `ga_workbook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for chiral-continuum extrapolation analysis used in the final analysis
* `data`: Directory of data
  * `github_ga_v1.csv`: Bootstrapped correlation function analysis results in csv format
    * Correlator data is made easily accessible from Jupyter with `pandas` and summarized in a dataframe
  * `hisq_params.csv`: a/w<sub>0</sub> and Î±<sub>s</sub> for HISQ ensembles used for this work in csv format
    * HISQ parameters are displayed in `pandas` dataframe
* `callat_ga_lib`: Library for extrapolation
  * correlator data formatting for `lsqfit`
  * fit function definitions
  * systematic error breakdown definitions
  * matplotlib routines
